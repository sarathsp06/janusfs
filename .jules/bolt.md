## 2026-07-20 - Ultra-Fast Pre-filtering & Allocation Bypass for Regexp-heavy FUSE Adapters
**Learning:** Regexp matching in Go's standard library is incredibly expensive and allocates a large number of slice headers and structures. When a filesystem adapter (like JanusFS) scans files continuously for secrets on every read, invoking regexes on 100% clean files introduces a massive CPU bottleneck. Furthermore, eagerly cloning file buffers (`bytes.Clone`) in anticipation of modifying them introduces a substantial memory allocation footprint even when no changes are made.
**Action:** Always pre-filter files using extremely fast, allocation-free substring or byte-containment checks (e.g., checking for `=` before invoking an environment-variable regex) before delegating to full regex searches. Additionally, only copy or clone buffers lazily when a modification span is actually found, ensuring clean files consume exactly 0 bytes in allocations.
